# This is your formative feedback for the IBI1 portfolio.


## Please do the following:

- [ ] Add this file to your GitHub fork of IBI1_2018-19. You are allowed to delete the last line (giving your score) before uploading the file to GitHub, if you do not want others to see it. 
- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:

- [ ]  The folder for Practical 3 should have a file called Reflection.txt, which contains your reflections about the practical, e.g. what went well and what you found difficult.

### Feedback Week 4:

- [ ] The code in variables.py is correct, but X and Y should be Booleans, not numbers

- [ ] collatz.py should output the Collatz sequence itself, not just its length 


### Feedback Week 5:

- [ ] The code for counting nucleotides and displaying the results is fine, but you should ask the user to input a nucleotide sequence, instead of hard-coding it in the script.

- [ ] The code for reverse ordering words and sorting them is fine, but you should ask the user to input the string. Look up the input() function for more information
